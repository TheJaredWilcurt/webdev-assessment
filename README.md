#### Expectations

* Be sure to read all the bullet points below.
* This assessment is split into 3 sections:
  * Logic - Required for all candidates
  * Frontend - (optional for backend candidates)
  * Backend - (optional for frontend candidates)
* You do **not** have to complete all assigned challenges/questions in each section, just get as far as you can with each of them.
* This is **not** a PASS/FAIL test. We want to see how you approach solving problems and your skill level for different aspects of development.

#### Global Guidelines for all challenges

* File names must remain the same as in the original repository so that reviewing your pull request is easier.
* Expect to be asked questions regarding your work on this assessment during the interview.
* Use the `time.txt` file to keep track of how much time was spent working on this assessment.
* Your last commit should not be more than 48 hours after your first commit (unless otherwise requested).
  * **Note:** You are not expected to complete 100% of this assessment. If an unexpected life event occurs that prevents you from spending the amount of time on this that you had planned, reach out to us so we can make appropriate arrangements with you regarding the rest of the assessment.
